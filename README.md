# recursion_root
A learning program in fortran, written to solve y=x^(1/z) for y.

This program is simply meant to be for me to use as a learning tool to understand recursive functions, specifically in FORTRAN.
I just wanted to mock up a quick mathematical solver using recursion. Here, I am relying on the fact that, for any z>1 and x>1,
1<y<x. under these conditions, the program, when compiled, will ask for the relevant inputs and converge recursively to an answer.
